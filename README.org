* cligu
Manage users and groups using a fancy syntax.

CLI for Groups and Users is a thin wrapper around the activeldap gem for environments that store their posix users and groups in openldap.

** Usage
: cligu [options] [command:user_or_group[operator<groups_or_users>][:attribute=value]*]*

Commands are:
- user
- group
- list:users and list:groups

Operators are:
- =+= add user to listed groups or members to group
- = explicitly set groups or members
- =%= remove a user from the listed groups or members from a group

Attributes are passed directly to LDAP.

*** Examples
- list all users and groups
: cligu list:users list:groups

- add the users bob, jon, and ron to the group "staff"
: cligu group:staff+bob,jon,ron

- remove jon and jack from the group "authors":
: cligu group:authors%jon,jack

- add the user alice to the group "staff" and change the login shell and mail address:
: cligu user:alice+staff:loginshell:/bin/zsh:mail=alice@example.com

which may need the following LDAP-ACL to work:
: access to attrs=loginshell,mail
:     by self write
:     by * break


- With the following command and LDAP-ACL, all members of any group with the description "selfsustained" can add or remove members to their group:
: cligu group:grassroots:description=selfsustained

: access to dn.sub="ou=groups,dc=example,dc=com" filter=(description=selfsustained) attr=memberUid
:     by set="this/memberUid & user/uid" manage
:     by *
:     break

** Cligu IRB Repl Mode Console
Run =cligu --irb= to get the Cligu Console.

Here you have direct access to Activeldap:
*Examples:*
: f = Users.find('funky')
: f.homedirectory = '/home/funky'
: f.save

: n = Users.new('neo')
: n.save
: pp n.errors ;nil

** Requirements
- The gems activeldap and ruby-ldap (see Gemfile).
- Currently, authentication is handled via Kerberos, so a working LDAP&Kerberos-Environment
- probably more

** Configuration
Configuration files are evaled in this order:
ENV['CLIGUCONF'], /etc/cligu_conf.rb, /etc/cligu.d/*_conf.rb, ~/.local/share/cligu/*_conf.rb, ~/.cligu_conf.rb

** Plans
- Extend documentation
- Authentication via Username+Password
- Syntax for creating users, groups
- Drop dependency on activeldap
